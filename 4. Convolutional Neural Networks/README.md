## Week 1: Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Learn to implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and to stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.
  
## Week 2: Deep convolutional models: case studies
  - Learn about the practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs straight from the research papers.
  
## Week 3: Object detection
  - Learn how to apply your knowledge of CNNs to one of the toughest but hottest field of computer vision: Object detection.
  
## Week 4: Special applications: Face recognition & Neural style transfer
  - Discover how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition. Implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!
