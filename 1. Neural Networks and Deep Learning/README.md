## Week 1: Introduction to deep learning
- Be able to explain the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and understand where and how it is applied today.

## Week 2: Neural Networks Basics
- Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

## Week 3: Shallow neural networks
- Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

## Week 4: Deep Neural Networks
- Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.
